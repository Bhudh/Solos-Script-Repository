<body><p>Solo's Script Repository is a collection of LSL scripts.
<p>LSL is 'Linden Scripting Language,' the in-world scripting language for virtual worlds like Second Life and the various OpenSimulator grids.
<p>There are a number of good sources of information about LSL, including Linden Lab's WIKI and a third-party WIKI called... LSLWiki.net.
<p>But what's missing is code that is commented and proper, that can send a newbie scripter in the right direction, rather than stumbling about, repeating the mistakes in open-source code from aeons past.
<p>And stuff.
<p>So I prettified some scripts I'd made, and commented them to death, and so here they are for you to enjoy.
<p>If you head to the repository site, you can do a checkout on the repository, or download them in a handy archive.
<p>This project is hosted at GitHub.com, which is quite an excellent service, and you should use them for your next software project hosting.
